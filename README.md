# NLP-Meets-Customer-Insights-A-Deep-Dive-into-Review-Analysis

Project: NLP Meets Customer Insights: A Deep Dive into Review Analysis
Project Overview
This project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews from restaurants, aiming to uncover insights regarding customer sentiments. By implementing various machine learning algorithms, we evaluate and compare their performance in sentiment classification, providing valuable information for businesses to improve customer satisfaction.

Key Components
1. Dataset
Source: Restaurant Reviews dataset (TSV format).
Features:
Review: Text of customer reviews.
Sentiment: Binary labels indicating positive or negative sentiment.
2. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Removal of special characters and conversion to lowercase.
Tokenization: Splitting reviews into individual words.
Stop Words Removal: Filtering out common words that do not impact sentiment.
Stemming: Reducing words to their root forms.
3. Feature Extraction
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical format for model training.
4. Model Selection
Various machine learning models were employed for sentiment classification:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVC)
XGBoost
LightGBM
Gaussian Naive Bayes
5. Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on:
Accuracy
Bias (Training Score)
Variance (Test Score)
AUC Score
6. Results
A summary of model performance was created to identify the best-performing model for sentiment analysis.
7. Visualizations
Confusion Matrix: To visualize prediction performance.
ROC Curve: To assess model performance and discrimination ability.
8. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated how NLP can be leveraged to analyze customer sentiments from reviews. By comparing various models, businesses can identify the most effective techniques for understanding customer feedback, ultimately enhancing their service quality.
